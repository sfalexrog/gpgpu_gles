# GPGPU with GLES

This repository currently has two main things:

* `gles_render_thread`: A ROS package that allows creating a render thread and an OpenGL ES context;
* `gles_demos`: Simple demos that utilize `gles_render_thread` to perform simple image processing operations on the GPU.

This is very much a work in progress, and all contributions are very welcome!
